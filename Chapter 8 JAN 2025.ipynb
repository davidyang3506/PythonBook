    "# Chapter 8: Capital Budgeting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to Capital Budgeting\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital budgeting is a fundamental process for financial managers to evaluate, compare, and select investment projects that are expected to enhance the company's value. The objective is to determine which investments are worthwhile by analyzing potential cash flows and expected returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficient Allocation of Capital\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital—whether sourced from debt or equity—is a finite resource. Financial managers must allocate it to projects that promise the highest returns, maximizing shareholder value. Even large, established firms face limits on raising capital, making project selection crucial for long-term success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Expenditures: Current vs. Capital\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Expenditures:**  Short-term expenses fully expensed in the same year (e.g., salaries, utilities, routine maintenance).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capital Expenditures:** Long-term investments amortized over years (e.g., machinery, land, R&D). These require careful analysis and are the focus of capital budgeting."
