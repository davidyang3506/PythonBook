    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s fast-paced financial world, the ability to efficiently analyze large datasets is crucial for making informed decisions. Python, with its extensive libraries and intuitive syntax, has become an indispensable tool for financial analysts. This book introduces Python to those new to financial data analysis, particularly undergraduate students and professionals beginning their journey in financial programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter is structured to cover fundamental financial concepts while using Python to solve practical financial problems. Throughout the book, we use Jupyter notebooks to present both theory and executable code examples. You'll learn how to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze financial data using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Additionally, you’ll gain hands-on experience accessing real-time data through the Tiingo API and implementing advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is tailored for readers with little to no prior experience in Python or financial data analysis. Whether you are a student learning financial programming for the first time or a professional looking to develop foundational Python skills, this book provides the tools and examples needed to apply Python to real-world financial challenges.\n",
